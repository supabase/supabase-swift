/// A WebSocket connection implementation using `URLSession`.
///
/// This class provides a WebSocket connection built on top of `URLSessionWebSocketTask`.
/// It handles connection lifecycle, message sending/receiving, and proper cleanup.
///
/// ## Thread Safety
/// This class is thread-safe and can be used from multiple concurrent contexts.
/// All operations are protected by internal synchronization mechanisms.
///
/// ## Connection Management
/// The connection is established asynchronously using the `connect(to:protocols:configuration:)` method.
/// Once connected, you can send text/binary messages and listen for events through the `onEvent` callback.
///
/// ## Error Handling
/// Network errors are automatically handled and converted to appropriate WebSocket close codes.
/// The connection will be closed gracefully when errors occur, with proper cleanup of resources.
