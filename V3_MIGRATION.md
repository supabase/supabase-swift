# V3 Migration Guide

This document describes the breaking changes you need to be aware of when upgrading to v3 of the
Supabase Swift SDK, together with the steps required to migrate your code. All modules
(`Auth`, `Storage`, `Realtime`, `PostgREST`, `Functions`, `Supabase`) are covered here.

> [!NOTE]
> v3 has not been released yet. This document is updated as breaking changes land on `main`, so
> treat it as the running list rather than the final one.

## `verifyOTP` now returns `VerifyOTPResponse` instead of `AuthResponse`

`verifyOTP` and its overloads return a new `VerifyOTPResponse` type instead of `AuthResponse`.

GoTrue's `/verify` endpoint returns a body with only `{ msg, code }` for the first of the two
confirmations required by a secure email change — a shape `AuthResponse` can't represent, since it
only ever holds a `Session` or a `User`. That made `verifyOTP(type: .emailChange)` throw a
`DecodingError` instead of completing successfully. `AuthResponse` is also the return type of
`signUp` and the Passkey methods, neither of which can ever produce that shape, so growing it to
fit `verifyOTP` would have meant every caller of those unrelated methods handling a case only one
specific call can trigger.

`VerifyOTPResponse` only has the two shapes `verifyOTP` can actually return:

```swift
public enum VerifyOTPResponse {
  case session(Session)
  case emailChangeConfirmationPending(EmailChangeConfirmation)
}
```

`EmailChangeConfirmation` carries the `message`/`code` GoTrue sends for that first confirmation.
There's no bare-`User` case here — succeeding at `/verify` always means either a session was
issued or the other email still needs to confirm; unlike `signUp`, it can never leave you with a
user and no session.

This is a compile error, not a silent behavior change: the return type itself changed, so every
call site using the result needs updating.

```swift
// Before
let response: AuthResponse = try await client.verifyOTP(tokenHash: hash, type: .emailChange)
let email = response.user.email

// After
let response: VerifyOTPResponse = try await client.verifyOTP(tokenHash: hash, type: .emailChange)
switch response {
case .session(let session):
  let email = session.user.email
case .emailChangeConfirmationPending(let confirmation):
  print("\(confirmation.message) (code: \(confirmation.code))")
}
```

`AuthResponse` itself is unchanged: `signUp` and the Passkey methods still return it, and `user` is
still non-optional there, since neither endpoint can produce the confirmation-pending shape.

## All previously-deprecated APIs have been removed

Every API that carried an `@available(*, deprecated, ...)` annotation ahead of v3 has now been
removed outright. If your project still built without deprecation warnings, none of this affects
you. If it built with warnings, each warning's replacement (already given in the deprecation
message) is now mandatory. This is a compile error everywhere: the old symbols no longer exist.

### Auth

| Before | After |
| --- | --- |
| `GoTrueClient` | `AuthClient` |
| `GoTrueMFA` | `AuthMFA` |
| `GoTrueLocalStorage` | `AuthLocalStorage` |
| `GoTrueMetaSecurity` | `AuthMetaSecurity` |
| `GoTrueError` | `AuthError` |
| `JSONEncoder.goTrue` | `AuthClient.Configuration.jsonEncoder` |
| `JSONDecoder.goTrue` | `AuthClient.Configuration.jsonDecoder` |
| `MFAEnrollParams` | `MFATotpEnrollParams` or `MFAPhoneEnrollParams` |
| `AuthAdmin.deleteUser(id: String, shouldSoftDelete:)` | `AuthAdmin.deleteUser(id: UUID, shouldSoftDelete:)` |
| `AuthError.sessionNotFound` | `AuthError.sessionMissing` |
| `AuthError.pkce(_:)` / `AuthError.PKCEFailureReason` | `AuthError.pkceGrantCodeExchange(message:error:code:)` |
| `AuthError.invalidImplicitGrantFlowURL` | `AuthError.implicitGrantRedirect(message:)` |
| `AuthError.api(_ error: APIError)` / `AuthError.APIError` | `AuthError.api(message:errorCode:underlyingData:underlyingResponse:)` |
| `UserAttributes.emailChangeToken` | *(removed, no replacement — was unused by GoTrue)* |

Also removed, with no replacement, because they no longer represent something GoTrue can throw:
`AuthError.missingExpClaim`, `AuthError.malformedJWT`, `AuthError.missingURL`,
`AuthError.invalidRedirectScheme`.

`UserCredentials` was deprecated ("access will be removed on the next major release") and is now
internal — it was only ever used by `AuthClient` itself to encode the request body for
`signIn(email:password:)`/`signIn(phone:password:)`/session refresh, never something callers were
meant to construct directly. Those `signIn` methods are unaffected; only direct use of the
`UserCredentials` type itself no longer compiles.

Customizing Auth's JSON encoding/decoding is no longer supported at all: the
`AuthClient.Configuration.init`/`AuthClient.init` overloads taking `encoder:`/`decoder:`
parameters, `AuthClient.Configuration.encoder`/`.decoder`, and
`SupabaseClientOptions.AuthOptions.encoder`/`.decoder` have all been removed. Auth always uses its
internal JSON encoder/decoder now.

```swift
// Before
let client = AuthClient(
  url: url, localStorage: storage, encoder: myEncoder, decoder: myDecoder,
  fetch: { try await URLSession.shared.data(for: $0) }
)

// After
let client = AuthClient(url: url, localStorage: storage)
```

### PostgREST

| Before | After |
| --- | --- |
| `URLQueryRepresentable` | `PostgrestFilterValue` |
| `PostgrestFilterValue.queryValue` | `PostgrestFilterValue.rawValue` |
| `.like(_:value:)` | `.like(_:pattern:)` |
| `.ilike(_:value:)` | `.ilike(_:pattern:)` |
| `.in(_:value:)` | `.in(_:values:)` |
| `.plfts(_:query:config:)` | `.textSearch(_:query:config:type: .plain)` |
| `.phfts(_:query:config:)` | `.textSearch(_:query:config:type: .phrase)` |
| `.wfts(_:query:config:)` | `.textSearch(_:query:config:type: .websearch)` |
| `.explain(...format: String)` | `.explain(...format: ExplainFormat)`, e.g. `format: .json` |

The `PostgrestClient.Configuration.init`/`PostgrestClient.init` overloads taking `encoder:`/
`decoder:` were also removed, for the same reason as Auth above — customizing PostgREST's JSON
codec is no longer supported.

```swift
// Before
try await client.from("users").select().ilike("email", value: "john%").execute()

// After
try await client.from("users").select().ilike("email", pattern: "john%").execute()
```

### Storage

| Before | After |
| --- | --- |
| `BucketOptions.public` / `init(public:...)` | `BucketOptions.isPublic` / `init(isPublic:...)` |
| `createSignedURL`/`createSignedURLs`/`getPublicURL(..., download: Bool)` | `download: DownloadBehavior?` (`.withOriginalName`, `.named("file.pdf")`) |
| `createSignedURLs(...) -> [URL]` | `createSignedURLs(...) -> [SignedURLResult]` |
| `upload`/`update`/`uploadToSignedURL(...) -> String` | the overloads returning `FileUploadResponse` / `SignedURLUploadResponse` |
| `SortBy.init(column:order: String?)` | `SortBy.init(column:order: SortOrder?)` |
| `TransformOptions.init(...resize: String?..., format: String?)` | `TransformOptions.init(...resize: ResizeMode?..., format: ImageFormat?)` |
| `JSONEncoder.defaultStorageEncoder` / `JSONDecoder.defaultStorageDecoder` | *(removed, no public replacement — was only ever the client's internal default)* |
| `StorageClientConfiguration.init(...encoder:decoder:session:...)` | `StorageClientConfiguration.init(...logger:...)` |
| `Storage.File` / `Storage.FormData` | `MultipartFormData` |

```swift
// Before
let bucket = try await storage.createBucket("avatars", options: .init(public: true))
let url = try await storage.from("avatars").createSignedURL(path: "a.png", expiresIn: 60, download: true)

// After
let bucket = try await storage.createBucket("avatars", options: .init(isPublic: true))
let url = try await storage.from("avatars").createSignedURL(
  path: "a.png", expiresIn: 60, download: .withOriginalName
)
```

### Supabase

`SupabaseClient.database` and `SupabaseClient.realtime` have been removed.

```swift
// Before
try await supabase.database.from("users").select().execute()
supabase.realtime.connect()

// After
try await supabase.from("users").select().execute()
supabase.realtimeV2.connect()
```

### Realtime

The entire legacy v1 API has been removed: `RealtimeClient`, `RealtimeChannel`, `Presence`, and
their supporting types (`PhoenixTransport`, `Push`, `Delegated`, `HeartbeatTimer`, `TimeoutTimer`,
and the `Message` typealias). Use `RealtimeClientV2`, `RealtimeChannelV2`, and `PresenceV2` — see
[the RealtimeV2 migration guide](docs/migrations/RealtimeV2%20Migration%20Guide.md) for the full
v1-to-v2 walkthrough.

`RealtimeClientV2` and `RealtimeChannelV2` also had their own deprecated compatibility members
removed:

| Before | After |
| --- | --- |
| `RealtimeClientV2.subscriptions` | `RealtimeClientV2.channels` |
| `RealtimeClientV2.Configuration` | `RealtimeClientOptions` |
| `RealtimeClientV2.Status` | `RealtimeClientStatus` |
| `RealtimeClientV2.init(config:)` | `RealtimeClientV2.init(url:options:)` |
| `RealtimeClientV2.addChannel(_:)` | *(removed — the client tracks channels automatically)* |
| `RealtimeChannelV2.Subscription` | `RealtimeSubscription` |
| `RealtimeChannelV2.Status` | `RealtimeChannelStatus` |
| `RealtimeChannelV2.subscribe()` | `RealtimeChannelV2.subscribeWithError()` |
| `RealtimeChannelV2.updateAuth(jwt:)` | `RealtimeClientV2.setAuth(_:)` |
| `postgresChange(_:schema:table:filter: String?:select:)` | `postgresChange(_:schema:table:filter: RealtimePostgresFilter?:select:)` |
| `broadcast(event:) -> AsyncStream<JSONObject>` | `broadcastStream(event:)` |
| `RealtimeMessageV2.eventType` | inspect the raw event value in `RealtimeMessageV2.event` instead |
| `RealtimeMessageV2.EventType.tokenExpired` | now returned as `.system`; check the payload instead |

### Helpers

`ObservationToken.remove()` has been removed — use `.cancel()` instead. `PostgrestError.detail`
and `PostgrestError.init(detail:hint:code:message:)` have been removed — use `.details` and
`init(details:hint:code:message:)`.
