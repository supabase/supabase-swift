# Supabase Swift v3.0.0 Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for Supabase Swift v3.0.0, a major version with breaking changes aimed at modernizing the API, improving developer experience, and aligning with current Swift best practices.

**Current Status**: Planning Phase
**Current Version**: v2.32.0
**Target Release**: TBD

## Key Objectives
- Modernize API design following current Swift patterns
- Improve type safety and developer experience
- Simplify configuration and initialization
- Enhanced async/await support
- Better error handling

- Improved real-time capabilities

## Breaking Changes Overview
v3.0.0 will introduce several breaking changes to improve the overall API design and developer experience. All changes will be documented in detail in the migration guide.

## Module Structure
Current modules will be maintained:
- **Supabase** (Main client)
- **Auth** (Authentication)
