## Recent Accomplishments ‚ú®
### Phase 1-3 ‚úÖ
- **Infrastructure Integration**: Alamofire networking, release-please, Swift 6.0 upgrade
- **Deprecated Code Removal**: Removed 4,525 lines of deprecated code across all modules
- **Realtime Modernization**: RealtimeV2 ‚Üí Realtime, now the primary implementation
- **API Cleanup**: All deprecated methods, properties, and classes removed

### Phase 4 (Partial) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **SupabaseClient Redesign**:
  - New protocol-based architecture with `SupabaseClientProtocol`
  - Factory pattern for dependency injection (`SupabaseClientFactory`)
  - Convenience initializers (`.production()`, `.development()`)
  - Enhanced configuration with better defaults and global timeout
  - Complete Alamofire integration throughout networking layer
- **PostgREST Enhancements**: Fixed missing text search methods (plfts, phfts, wfts)
- **Storage Configuration**: Enhanced with upload retry and timeout options

### Issues Encountered üêõ
- **Auth Module Compilation**: Several breaking API issues after deprecated code removal
- **Swift 6.0 Concurrency**: Some global mutable state issues need resolution
- **API Consistency**: Some deprecated references still exist in various modules
