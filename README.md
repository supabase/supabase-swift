[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/supabase/supabase-swift/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/supabase/supabase-swift?branch=main)

Supabase client for Swift. Mirrors the design of [supabase-js](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/blob/master/README.md).

* Documentation: [https://supabase.com/docs/reference/swift/introduction](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/swift/introduction)

## Usage

### Requirements
- iOS 13.0+ / macOS 10.15+ / tvOS 13+ / watchOS 6+ / visionOS 1+
- Xcode 15+
- Swift 5.9+

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Check the [Support Policy](#support-policy) to learn when dropping Xcode, Swift, and platform versions will not be considered a **breaking change**.

### Installation
Install the library using the Swift Package Manager.

```swift
let package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        ...
        .package(
            url: "https://github.com/supabase/supabase-swift.git",
            from: "2.0.0"
        ),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "YourTargetName",
            dependencies: [
                .product(name: "Supabase", package: "supabase-swift") // Add as a dependency
            ]
        )
    ]
)
```

If you're using Xcode, [use this guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) to add `supabase-swift` to your project. Use `https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-swift.git` for the url when Xcode asks.

If you don't want the full Supabase environment, you can also add individual packages, such as `Functions`, `Auth`, `Realtime`, `Storage`, or `PostgREST`.

Then you're able to import the package and establish the connection with the database.

```swift
/// Create a single supabase client for interacting with your database
let client = SupabaseClient(supabaseURL: URL(string: "https://xyzcompany.supabase.co")!, supabaseKey: "public-anon-key")
```

### Initialize with custom options

```swift
let client = SupabaseClient(
    supabaseURL: URL(string: "https://xyzcompany.supabase.co")!, 
    supabaseKey: "public-anon-key",
    options: SupabaseClientOptions(
        db: .init(
            schema: "public"
        ),
        auth: .init(
            storage: MyCustomLocalStorage(),
            flowType: .pkce
        ),
        global: .init(
            headers: ["x-my-custom-header": "my-app-name"],
            session: URLSession.myCustomSession
        )
    )
)
```

## Support Policy

This document outlines the scope of support for Xcode, Swift, and the various platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS) in Supabase.

### Xcode
We only support Xcode versions that are currently eligible for submitting apps to the App Store. Once a specific version of Xcode is no longer supported, its removal from Supabase **won't be treated as a breaking change** and will occur in a minor release.

### Swift
The minimum supported Swift version corresponds to the minor version released with the oldest-supported Xcode version. When a Swift version reaches its end of support, it will be dropped from Supabase in a **minor release**, and **this won't be considered a breaking change**.

### Platforms
We maintain support for the four latest major versions of each platform, including the current version.

When a platform version is no longer supported, Supabase will drop it in a **minor release**, and **this won't count as a breaking change**. For instance, iOS 14 will no longer be supported after the release of iOS 18, allowing its removal in a minor update.

For macOS, the named yearly releases are treated as major versions for this policy, regardless of their version numbers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Android, Linux and Windows works but aren't supported, and may stop working on future versions of the library.
